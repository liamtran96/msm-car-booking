This is a list of terms and their meaning in the context of PostgreSQL and relational database systems in general.

Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. This set of properties of database transactions is intended to guarantee validity in concurrent operation and even in event of errors, power failures, etc.

A function that combines (aggregates) multiple input values, for example by counting, averaging or adding, yielding a single output value.

For more information, see Section 9.21.

See Also Window function (routine).

Interfaces which PostgreSQL use in order to access data in tables and indexes. This abstraction allows for adding support for new types of data storage.

For more information, see Chapter 62 and Chapter 63.

See Window function (routine).

The act of collecting statistics from data in tables and other relations to help the query planner to make decisions about how to execute queries.

(Don't confuse this term with the ANALYZE option to the EXPLAIN command.)

For more information, see ANALYZE.

Asynchronous I/O (AIO) describes performing I/O in a non-blocking way (asynchronously), in contrast to synchronous I/O, which blocks for the entire duration of the I/O.

With AIO, starting an I/O operation is separated from waiting for the result of the operation, allowing multiple I/O operations to be initiated concurrently, as well as performing CPU heavy operations concurrently with I/O. The price for that increased concurrency is increased complexity.

See Also Input/Output.

In reference to a datum: the fact that its value cannot be broken down into smaller components.

In reference to a database transaction: see atomicity.

The property of a transaction that either all its operations complete as a single unit or none do. In addition, if a system failure occurs during the execution of a transaction, no partial results are visible after recovery. This is one of the ACID properties.

An element with a certain name and data type found within a tuple.

A set of background processes that routinely perform vacuum and analyze operations. The auxiliary process that coordinates the work and is always present (unless autovacuum is disabled) is known as the autovacuum launcher, and the processes that carry out the tasks are known as the autovacuum workers.

For more information, see Section 24.1.6.

A process within an instance that is in charge of some specific background task for the instance. The auxiliary processes consist of the autovacuum launcher (but not the autovacuum workers), the background writer, the checkpointer, the logger, the startup process, the WAL archiver, the WAL receiver (but not the WAL senders), the WAL summarizer, and the WAL writer.

Process of an instance which acts on behalf of a client session and handles its requests.

(Don't confuse this term with the similar terms Background Worker or Background Writer).

Process within an instance, which runs system- or user-supplied code. Serves as infrastructure for several features in PostgreSQL, such as logical replication and parallel queries. In addition, Extensions can add custom background worker processes.

For more information, see Chapter 46.

An auxiliary process that writes dirty data pages from shared memory to the file system. It wakes up periodically, but works only for a short period in order to distribute its expensive I/O activity over time to avoid generating larger I/O peaks which could block other processes.

For more information, see Section 19.4.4.

A binary copy of all database cluster files. It is generated by the tool pg_basebackup. In combination with WAL files it can be used as the starting point for recovery, log shipping, or streaming replication.

Space in data pages which does not contain current row versions, such as unused (free) space or outdated row versions.

The first user initialized in a database cluster.

This user owns all system catalog tables in each database. It is also the role from which all granted permissions originate. Because of these things, this role may not be dropped.

This role also behaves as a normal database superuser, and its superuser status cannot be removed.

Some operations will access a large number of pages. A Buffer Access Strategy helps to prevent these operations from evicting too many pages from shared buffers.

A Buffer Access Strategy sets up references to a limited number of shared buffers and reuses them circularly. When the operation requires a new page, a victim buffer is chosen from the buffers in the strategy ring, which may require flushing the page's dirty data and possibly also unflushed WAL to permanent storage.

Buffer Access Strategies are used for various operations such as sequential scans of large tables, VACUUM, COPY, CREATE TABLE AS SELECT, ALTER TABLE, CREATE DATABASE, CREATE INDEX, and CLUSTER.

A conversion of a datum from its current data type to another data type.

For more information, see CREATE CAST.

The SQL standard uses this term to indicate what is called a database in PostgreSQL's terminology.

(Don't confuse this term with system catalog).

For more information, see Section 22.1.

A type of constraint defined on a relation which restricts the values allowed in one or more attributes. The check constraint can make reference to any attribute of the same row in the relation, but cannot reference other rows of the same relation or other relations.

For more information, see Section 5.5.

A point in the WAL sequence at which it is guaranteed that the heap and index data files have been updated with all information from shared memory modified before that checkpoint; a checkpoint record is written and flushed to WAL to mark that point.

A checkpoint is also the act of carrying out all the actions that are necessary to reach a checkpoint as defined above. This process is initiated when predefined conditions are met, such as a specified amount of time has passed, or a certain volume of records has been written; or it can be invoked by the user with the command CHECKPOINT.

For more information, see Section 28.5.

An auxiliary process that is responsible for executing checkpoints.

Any process, possibly remote, that establishes a session by connecting to an instance to interact with a database.

The operating system user that owns the data directory and under which the postgres process is run. It is required that this user exist prior to creating a new database cluster.

On operating systems with a root user, said user is not allowed to be the cluster owner.

An attribute found in a table or view.

The act of finalizing a transaction within the database, which makes it visible to other transactions and assures its durability.

For more information, see COMMIT.

The concept that multiple independent operations happen within the database at the same time. In PostgreSQL, concurrency is controlled by the multiversion concurrency control mechanism.

An established line of communication between a client process and a backend process, usually over a network, supporting a session. This term is sometimes used as a synonym for session.

For more information, see Section 19.3.

The property that the data in the database is always in compliance with integrity constraints. Transactions may be allowed to violate some of the constraints transiently before it commits, but if such violations are not resolved by the time it commits, such a transaction is automatically rolled back. This is one of the ACID properties.

A restriction on the values of data allowed within a table, or in attributes of a domain.

For more information, see Section 5.5.

A system which, if enabled, accumulates statistical information about the instance's activities.

For more information, see Section 27.2.

A named collection of local SQL objects.

For more information, see Section 22.1.

A collection of databases and global SQL objects, and their common static and dynamic metadata. Sometimes referred to as a cluster. A database cluster is created using the initdb program.

In PostgreSQL, the term cluster is also sometimes used to refer to an instance. (Don't confuse this term with the SQL command CLUSTER.)

See also cluster owner, the operating-system owner of a cluster, and bootstrap superuser, the PostgreSQL owner of a cluster.

A role having superuser status (see Section 21.2).

Frequently referred to as superuser.

The base directory on the file system of a server that contains all data files and subdirectories associated with a database cluster (with the exception of tablespaces, and optionally WAL). The environment variable PGDATA is commonly used to refer to the data directory.

A cluster's storage space comprises the data directory plus any additional tablespaces.

For more information, see Section 66.1.

The basic structure used to store relation data. All pages are of the same size. Data pages are typically stored on disk, each in a specific file, and can be read to shared buffers where they can be modified, becoming dirty. They become clean when written to disk. New pages, which initially exist in memory only, are also dirty until written.

The internal representation of one value of an SQL data type.

An SQL command which removes rows from a given table or relation.

For more information, see DELETE.

A user-defined data type that is based on another underlying data type. It acts the same as the underlying type except for possibly restricting the set of allowed values.

For more information, see Section 8.18.

The assurance that once a transaction has been committed, the changes remain even after a system failure or crash. This is one of the ACID properties.

A software add-on package that can be installed on an instance to get extra features.

For more information, see Section 36.17.

A physical file which stores data for a given relation. File segments are limited in size by a configuration value (typically 1 gigabyte), so if a relation exceeds that size, it is split into multiple segments.

For more information, see Section 66.1.

(Don't confuse this term with the similar term WAL segment).

A means of representing data that is not contained in the local database so that it appears as if were in local table(s). With a foreign data wrapper it is possible to define a foreign server and foreign tables.

For more information, see CREATE FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER.

A type of constraint defined on one or more columns in a table which requires the value(s) in those columns to identify zero or one row in another (or, infrequently, the same) table.

A named collection of foreign tables which all use the same foreign data wrapper and have other configuration values in common.

For more information, see CREATE SERVER.

A relation which appears to have rows and columns similar to a regular table, but will forward requests for data through its foreign data wrapper, which will return result sets structured according to the definition of the foreign table.

For more information, see CREATE FOREIGN TABLE.

Each of the separate segmented file sets in which a relation is stored. The main fork is where the actual data resides. There also exist two secondary forks for metadata: the free space map and the visibility map. Unlogged relations also have an init fork.

A storage structure that keeps metadata about each data page of a table's main fork. The free space map entry for each page stores the amount of free space that's available for future tuples, and is structured to be efficiently searched for available space for a new tuple of a given size.

For more information, see Section 66.3.

A type of routine that receives zero or more arguments, returns zero or more output values, and is constrained to run within one transaction. Functions are invoked as part of a query, for example via SELECT. Certain functions can return sets; those are called set-returning functions.

Functions can also be used for triggers to invoke.

For more information, see CREATE FUNCTION.

An SQL command that is used to allow a user or role to access specific objects within the database.

For more information, see GRANT.

Contains the values of row attributes (i.e., the data) for a relation. The heap is realized within one or more file segments in the relation's main fork.

A computer that communicates with other computers over a network. This is sometimes used as a synonym for server. It is also used to refer to a computer where client processes run.

A relation that contains data derived from a table or materialized view. Its internal structure supports fast retrieval of and access to the original data.

For more information, see CREATE INDEX.

A special base backup that for some files may contain only those pages that were modified since a previous backup, as opposed to the full contents of every file. Like base backups, it is generated by the tool pg_basebackup.

To restore incremental backups the tool pg_combinebackup is used, which combines incremental backups with a base backup. Afterwards, recovery can use WAL to bring the database cluster to a consistent state.

For more information, see Section 25.3.3.

Input/Output (I/O) describes the communication between a program and peripheral devices. In the context of database systems, I/O commonly, but not exclusively, refers to interaction with storage devices or the network.

See Also Asynchronous I/O.

An SQL command used to add new data into a table.

For more information, see INSERT.

A group of backend and auxiliary processes that communicate using a common shared memory area. One postmaster process manages the instance; one instance manages exactly one database cluster with all its databases. Many instances can run on the same server as long as their TCP ports do not conflict.

The instance handles all key features of a DBMS: read and write access to files and shared memory, assurance of the ACID properties, connections to client processes, privilege verification, crash recovery, replication, etc.

The property that the effects of a transaction are not visible to concurrent transactions before it commits. This is one of the ACID properties.

For more information, see Section 13.2.

An operation and SQL keyword used in queries for combining data from multiple relations.

A means of identifying a row within a table or other relation by values contained within one or more attributes in that relation.

A mechanism that allows a process to limit or prevent simultaneous access to a resource.

Log files contain human-readable text lines about events. Examples include login failures, long-running queries, etc.

For more information, see Section 24.3.

A table is considered logged if changes to it are sent to the WAL. By default, all regular tables are logged. A table can be specified as unlogged either at creation time or via the ALTER TABLE command.

An auxiliary process which, if enabled, writes information about database events into the current log file. When reaching certain time- or volume-dependent criteria, a new log file is created. Also called syslogger.

For more information, see Section 19.8.

A set of publisher and subscriber instances with the publisher instance replicating changes to the subscriber instance.

Archaic term for a WAL record.

Byte offset into the WAL, increasing monotonically with each new WAL record.

For more information, see pg_lsn and Section 28.6.

See Log sequence number.

See Primary (server).

The property that some information has been pre-computed and stored for later use, rather than computing it on-the-fly.

This term is used in materialized view, to mean that the data derived from the view's query is stored on disk separately from the sources of that data.

This term is also used to refer to some multi-step queries to mean that the data resulting from executing a given step is stored in memory (with the possibility of spilling to disk), so that it can be read multiple times by another step.

A relation that is defined by a SELECT statement (just like a view), but stores data in the same way that a table does. It cannot be modified via INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or MERGE operations.

For more information, see CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW.

An SQL command used to conditionally add, modify, or remove rows in a given table, using data from a source relation.

For more information, see MERGE.

A mechanism designed to allow several transactions to be reading and writing the same rows without one process causing other processes to stall. In PostgreSQL, MVCC is implemented by creating copies (versions) of tuples as they are modified; after transactions that can see the old versions terminate, those old versions need to be removed.

A concept of non-existence that is a central tenet of relational database theory. It represents the absence of a definite value.

The ability to handle parts of executing a query to take advantage of parallel processes on servers with multiple CPUs.

One of several disjoint (not overlapping) subsets of a larger set.

In reference to a partitioned table: One of the tables that each contain part of the data of the partitioned table, which is said to be the parent. The partition is itself a table, so it can also be queried directly; at the same time, a partition can sometimes be a partitioned table, allowing hierarchies to be created.

In reference to a window function in a query, a partition is a user-defined criterion that identifies which neighboring rows of the query's result set can be considered by the function.

A relation that is in semantic terms the same as a table, but whose storage is distributed across several partitions.

The very first process of an instance. It starts and manages the auxiliary processes and creates backend processes on demand.

For more information, see Section 18.3.

A special case of a unique constraint defined on a table or other relation that also guarantees that all of the attributes within the primary key do not have null values. As the name implies, there can be only one primary key per table, though it is possible to have multiple unique constraints that also have no null-capable attributes.

When two or more databases are linked via replication, the server that is considered the authoritative source of information is called the primary, also known as a master.

A type of routine. Their distinctive qualities are that they do not return values, and that they are allowed to make transactional statements such as COMMIT and ROLLBACK. They are invoked via the CALL command.

For more information, see CREATE PROCEDURE.

A request sent by a client to a backend, usually to return results or to modify data on the database.

The part of PostgreSQL that is devoted to determining (planning) the most efficient way to execute queries. Also known as query optimizer, optimizer, or simply planner.

A means of restricting data in one relation by a foreign key so that it must have matching data in another relation.

The generic term for all objects in a database that have a name and a list of attributes defined in a specific order. Tables, sequences, views, foreign tables, materialized views, composite types, and indexes are all relations.

More generically, a relation is a set of tuples; for example, the result of a query is also a relation.

In PostgreSQL, Class is an archaic synonym for relation.

A database that is paired with a primary database and is maintaining a copy of some or all of the primary database's data. The foremost reasons for doing this are to allow for greater access to that data, and to maintain availability of the data in the event that the primary becomes unavailable.

The act of reproducing data on one server onto another server called a replica. This can take the form of physical replication, where all file changes from one server are copied verbatim, or logical replication where a defined subset of data changes are conveyed using a higher-level representation.

A variant of a checkpoint performed on a replica.

For more information, see Section 28.5.

A relation transmitted from a backend process to a client upon the completion of an SQL command, usually a SELECT but it can be an INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or MERGE command if the RETURNING clause is specified.

The fact that a result set is a relation means that a query can be used in the definition of another query, becoming a subquery.

A command to prevent access to a named set of database objects for a named list of roles.

For more information, see REVOKE.

A collection of access privileges to the instance. Roles are themselves a privilege that can be granted to other roles. This is often done for convenience or to ensure completeness when multiple users need the same privileges.

For more information, see CREATE ROLE.

A command to undo all of the operations performed since the beginning of a transaction.

For more information, see ROLLBACK.

A defined set of instructions stored in the database system that can be invoked for execution. A routine can be written in a variety of programming languages. Routines can be functions (including set-returning functions and trigger functions), aggregate functions, and procedures.

Many routines are already defined within PostgreSQL itself, but user-defined ones can also be added.

A special mark in the sequence of steps in a transaction. Data modifications after this point in time may be reverted to the time of the savepoint.

For more information, see SAVEPOINT.

A schema is a namespace for SQL objects, which all reside in the same database. Each SQL object must reside in exactly one schema.

All system-defined SQL objects reside in schema pg_catalog.

More generically, the term schema is used to mean all data descriptions (table definitions, constraints, comments, etc.) for a given database or subset thereof.

For more information, see Section 5.10.

The SQL command used to request data from a database. Normally, SELECT commands are not expected to modify the database in any way, but it is possible that functions invoked within the query could have side effects that do modify data.

For more information, see SELECT.

A type of relation that is used to generate values. Typically the generated values are sequential non-repeating numbers. They are commonly used to generate surrogate primary key values.

A computer on which PostgreSQL instances run. The term server denotes real hardware, a container, or a virtual machine.

This term is sometimes used to refer to an instance or to a host.

A state that allows a client and a backend to interact, communicating over a connection.

RAM which is used by the processes common to an instance. It mirrors parts of database files, provides a transient area for WAL records, and stores additional common information. Note that shared memory belongs to the complete instance, not to a single database.

The largest part of shared memory is known as shared buffers and is used to mirror part of data files, organized into pages. When a page is modified, it is called a dirty page until it is written back to the file system.

For more information, see Section 19.4.1.

Any object that can be created with a CREATE command. Most objects are specific to one database, and are commonly known as local objects.

Most local objects reside in a specific schema in their containing database, such as relations (all types), routines (all types), data types, etc. The names of such objects of the same type in the same schema are enforced to be unique.

There also exist local objects that do not reside in schemas; some examples are extensions, data type casts, and foreign data wrappers. The names of such objects of the same type are enforced to be unique within the database.
