## 38.5. A Database Login Event Trigger Example #

- 38.5. A Database Login Event Trigger Example #

The event trigger on the login event can be useful for logging user logins, for verifying the connection and assigning roles according to current circumstances, or for session data initialization. It is very important that any event trigger using the login event checks whether or not the database is in recovery before performing any writes. Writing to a standby server will make it inaccessible.

The following example demonstrates these options.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (sql):
```sql
-- create test tables and roles
CREATE TABLE user_login_log (
  "user" text,
  "session_start" timestamp with time zone
);
CREATE ROLE day_worker;
CREATE ROLE night_worker;

-- the example trigger function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION init_session()
  RETURNS event_trigger SECURITY DEFINER
  LANGUAGE plpgsql AS
$$
DECLARE
  hour integer = EXTRACT('hour' FROM current_time at time zone 'utc');
  rec boolean;
BEGIN
-- 1. Forbid logging in between 2AM and 4AM.
IF hour BETWEEN 2 AND 4 THEN
  RAISE EXCEPTION 'Login forbidden';
END IF;

-- The checks below cannot be performed on standby servers so
-- ensure the database is not in recovery before we perform any
-- operations.
SELECT pg_is_in_recovery() INTO rec;
IF rec THEN
  RETURN;
END IF;

-- 2. Assign some roles. At daytime, grant the day_worker role, else the
-- night_worker role.
IF hour BETWEEN 8 AND 20 THEN
  EXECUTE 'REVOKE night_worker FROM ' || quote_ident(session_user);
  EXECUTE 'GRANT day_worker TO ' || quote_ident(session_user);
ELSE
  EXECUTE 'REVOKE day_worker FROM ' || quote_ident(session_user);
  EXECUTE 'GRANT night_worker TO ' || quote_ident(session_user);
END IF;

-- 3. Initialize user session data
CREATE TEMP TABLE session_storage (x float, y integer);
ALTER TABLE session_storage OWNER TO session_user;

-- 4. Log the connection time
INSERT INTO public.user_login_log VALUES (session_user, current_timestamp);

END;
$$;

-- trigger definition
CREATE EVENT TRIGGER init_session
  ON login
  EXECUTE FUNCTION init_session();
ALTER EVENT TRIGGER init_session ENABLE ALWAYS;
```

## 38.2. Writing Event Trigger Functions in C #


**URL:** https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/event-trigger-interface.html

**Contents:**
- 38.2. Writing Event Trigger Functions in C #

This section describes the low-level details of the interface to an event trigger function. This information is only needed when writing event trigger functions in C. If you are using a higher-level language then these details are handled for you. In most cases you should consider using a procedural language before writing your event triggers in C. The documentation of each procedural language explains how to write an event trigger in that language.

Event trigger functions must use the “version 1” function manager interface.

When a function is called by the event trigger manager, it is not passed any normal arguments, but it is passed a “context” pointer pointing to a EventTriggerData structure. C functions can check whether they were called from the event trigger manager or not by executing the macro:

If this returns true, then it is safe to cast fcinfo->context to type EventTriggerData * and make use of the pointed-to EventTriggerData structure. The function must not alter the EventTriggerData structure or any of the data it points to.

struct EventTriggerData is defined in commands/event_trigger.h:

where the members are defined as follows:

Always T_EventTriggerData.

Describes the event for which the function is called, one of "login", "ddl_command_start", "ddl_command_end", "sql_drop", "table_rewrite". See Section 38.1 for the meaning of these events.

A pointer to the parse tree of the command. Check the PostgreSQL source code for details. The parse tree structure is subject to change without notice.

The command tag associated with the event for which the event trigger is run, for example "CREATE FUNCTION".

An event trigger function must return a NULL pointer (not an SQL null value, that is, do not set isNull true).

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
EventTriggerData
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
CALLED_AS_EVENT_TRIGGER(fcinfo)
```

Example 3 (php):
```php
((fcinfo)->context != NULL && IsA((fcinfo)->context, EventTriggerData))
```

Example 4 (php):
```php
fcinfo->context
```

## Chapter 38. Event Triggers


**URL:** https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/event-triggers.html

**Contents:**
- Chapter 38. Event Triggers

To supplement the trigger mechanism discussed in Chapter 37, PostgreSQL also provides event triggers. Unlike regular triggers, which are attached to a single table and capture only DML events, event triggers are global to a particular database and are capable of capturing DDL events.

Like regular triggers, event triggers can be written in any procedural language that includes event trigger support, or in C, but not in plain SQL.

## 38.1. Overview of Event Trigger Behavior #


**URL:** https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/event-trigger-definition.html

**Contents:**
- 38.1. Overview of Event Trigger Behavior #
  - 38.1.1. login #
  - 38.1.2. ddl_command_start #
  - 38.1.3. ddl_command_end #
  - 38.1.4. sql_drop #
  - 38.1.5. table_rewrite #
  - 38.1.6. Event Triggers in Aborted Transactions #
  - 38.1.7. Creating Event Triggers #

An event trigger fires whenever the event with which it is associated occurs in the database in which it is defined. Currently, the supported events are login, ddl_command_start, ddl_command_end, table_rewrite and sql_drop. Support for additional events may be added in future releases.

The login event occurs when an authenticated user logs into the system. Any bug in a trigger procedure for this event may prevent successful login to the system. Such bugs may be worked around by setting event_triggers to false either in a connection string or configuration file. Alternatively, you can restart the system in single-user mode (as event triggers are disabled in this mode). See the postgres reference page for details about using single-user mode. The login event will also fire on standby servers. To prevent servers from becoming inaccessible, such triggers must avoid writing anything to the database when running on a standby. Also, it's recommended to avoid long-running queries in login event triggers. Note that, for instance, canceling a connection in psql will not cancel the in-progress login trigger.

For an example on how to use the login event trigger, see Section 38.5.

The ddl_command_start event occurs just before the execution of a DDL command. DDL commands in this context are:

IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA

REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW

ddl_command_start also occurs just before the execution of a SELECT INTO command, since this is equivalent to CREATE TABLE AS.

As an exception, this event does not occur for DDL commands targeting shared objects:

roles (role definitions and role memberships)

This event also does not occur for commands targeting event triggers themselves.

No check whether the affected object exists or doesn't exist is performed before the event trigger fires.

The ddl_command_end event occurs just after the execution of the same set of commands as ddl_command_start. To obtain more details on the DDL operations that took place, use the set-returning function pg_event_trigger_ddl_commands() from the ddl_command_end event trigger code (see Section 9.30). Note that the trigger fires after the actions have taken place (but before the transaction commits), and thus the system catalogs can be read as already changed.

The sql_drop event occurs just before the ddl_command_end event trigger for any operation that drops database objects. Note that besides the obvious DROP commands, some ALTER commands can also trigger an sql_drop event.

To list the objects that have been dropped, use the set-returning function pg_event_trigger_dropped_objects() from the sql_drop event trigger code (see Section 9.30). Note that the trigger is executed after the objects have been deleted from the system catalogs, so it's not possible to look them up anymore.

The table_rewrite event occurs just before a table is rewritten by some actions of the commands ALTER TABLE and ALTER TYPE. While other control statements are available to rewrite a table, like CLUSTER and VACUUM, the table_rewrite event is not triggered by them. To find the OID of the table that was rewritten, use the function pg_event_trigger_table_rewrite_oid(), to discover the reason(s) for the rewrite, use the function pg_event_trigger_table_rewrite_reason() (see Section 9.30).

Event triggers (like other functions) cannot be executed in an aborted transaction. Thus, if a DDL command fails with an error, any associated ddl_command_end triggers will not be executed. Conversely, if a ddl_command_start trigger fails with an error, no further event triggers will fire, and no attempt will be made to execute the command itself. Similarly, if a ddl_command_end trigger fails with an error, the effects of the DDL statement will be rolled back, just as they would be in any other case where the containing transaction aborts.

Event triggers are created using the command CREATE EVENT TRIGGER. In order to create an event trigger, you must first create a function with the special return type event_trigger. This function need not (and may not) return a value; the return type serves merely as a signal that the function is to be invoked as an event trigger.

If more than one event trigger is defined for a particular event, they will fire in alphabetical order by trigger name.

A trigger definition can also specify a WHEN condition so that, for example, a ddl_command_start trigger can be fired only for particular commands which the user wishes to intercept. A common use of such triggers is to restrict the range of DDL operations which users may perform.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
ddl_command_start
```

Example 2 (unknown):
```unknown
ddl_command_end
```

Example 3 (unknown):
```unknown
table_rewrite
```

Example 4 (unknown):
```unknown
ddl_command_start
```

- 38.4. A Table Rewrite Event Trigger Example #

Thanks to the table_rewrite event, it is possible to implement a table rewriting policy only allowing the rewrite in maintenance windows.

Here's an example implementing such a policy.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
table_rewrite
```

Example 2 (sql):
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION no_rewrite()
 RETURNS event_trigger
 LANGUAGE plpgsql AS
$$
---
--- Implement local Table Rewriting policy:
---   public.foo is not allowed rewriting, ever
---   other tables are only allowed rewriting between 1am and 6am
---   unless they have more than 100 blocks
---
DECLARE
  table_oid oid := pg_event_trigger_table_rewrite_oid();
  current_hour integer := extract('hour' from current_time);
  pages integer;
  max_pages integer := 100;
BEGIN
  IF pg_event_trigger_table_rewrite_oid() = 'public.foo'::regclass
  THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'you''re not allowed to rewrite the table %',
                        table_oid::regclass;
  END IF;

  SELECT INTO pages relpages FROM pg_class WHERE oid = table_oid;
  IF pages > max_pages
  THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'rewrites only allowed for table with less than % pages',
                        max_pages;
  END IF;

  IF current_hour NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 6
  THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'rewrites only allowed between 1am and 6am';
  END IF;
END;
$$;

CREATE EVENT TRIGGER no_rewrite_allowed
                  ON table_rewrite
   EXECUTE FUNCTION no_rewrite();
```

## 38.3. A Complete Event Trigger Example #


**URL:** https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/event-trigger-example.html

**Contents:**
- 38.3. A Complete Event Trigger Example #

Here is a very simple example of an event trigger function written in C. (Examples of triggers written in procedural languages can be found in the documentation of the procedural languages.)

The function noddl raises an exception each time it is called. The event trigger definition associated the function with the ddl_command_start event. The effect is that all DDL commands (with the exceptions mentioned in Section 38.1) are prevented from running.

This is the source code of the trigger function:

After you have compiled the source code (see Section 36.10.5), declare the function and the triggers:

Now you can test the operation of the trigger:

In this situation, in order to be able to run some DDL commands when you need to do so, you have to either drop the event trigger or disable it. It can be convenient to disable the trigger for only the duration of a transaction:

(Recall that DDL commands on event triggers themselves are not affected by event triggers.)

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
ddl_command_start
```

Example 2 (json):
```json
#include "postgres.h"

#include "commands/event_trigger.h"
#include "fmgr.h"

PG_MODULE_MAGIC;

PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1(noddl);

Datum
noddl(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
    EventTriggerData *trigdata;

    if (!CALLED_AS_EVENT_TRIGGER(fcinfo))  /* internal error */
        elog(ERROR, "not fired by event trigger manager");

    trigdata = (EventTriggerData *) fcinfo->context;

    ereport(ERROR,
            (errcode(ERRCODE_INSUFFICIENT_PRIVILEGE),
             errmsg("command \"%s\" denied",
                    GetCommandTagName(trigdata->tag))));

    PG_RETURN_NULL();
}
```

Example 3 (javascript):
```javascript
CREATE FUNCTION noddl() RETURNS event_trigger
    AS 'noddl' LANGUAGE C;

CREATE EVENT TRIGGER noddl ON ddl_command_start
    EXECUTE FUNCTION noddl();
```

Example 4 (yaml):
```yaml
=# \dy
                     List of event triggers
 Name  |       Event       | Owner | Enabled | Function | Tags
-------+-------------------+-------+---------+----------+------
 noddl | ddl_command_start | dim   | enabled | noddl    |
(1 row)

=# CREATE TABLE foo(id serial);
ERROR:  command "CREATE TABLE" denied
```
