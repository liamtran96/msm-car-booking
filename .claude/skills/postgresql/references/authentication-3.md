OAuth 2.0 is an industry-standard framework, defined in RFC 6749, to enable third-party applications to obtain limited access to a protected resource. OAuth client support has to be enabled when PostgreSQL is built, see Chapter 17 for more information.

This documentation uses the following terminology when discussing the OAuth ecosystem:

The user or system who owns protected resources and can grant access to them. This documentation also uses the term end user when the resource owner is a person. When you use psql to connect to the database using OAuth, you are the resource owner/end user.

The system which accesses the protected resources using access tokens. Applications using libpq, such as psql, are the OAuth clients when connecting to a PostgreSQL cluster.

The system hosting the protected resources which are accessed by the client. The PostgreSQL cluster being connected to is the resource server.

The organization, product vendor, or other entity which develops and/or administers the OAuth authorization servers and clients for a given application. Different providers typically choose different implementation details for their OAuth systems; a client of one provider is not generally guaranteed to have access to the servers of another.

This use of the term "provider" is not standard, but it seems to be in wide use colloquially. (It should not be confused with OpenID's similar term "Identity Provider". While the implementation of OAuth in PostgreSQL is intended to be interoperable and compatible with OpenID Connect/OIDC, it is not itself an OIDC client and does not require its use.)

The system which receives requests from, and issues access tokens to, the client after the authenticated resource owner has given approval. PostgreSQL does not provide an authorization server; it is the responsibility of the OAuth provider.

An identifier for an authorization server, printed as an https:// URL, which provides a trusted "namespace" for OAuth clients and applications. The issuer identifier allows a single authorization server to talk to the clients of mutually untrusting entities, as long as they maintain separate issuers.

For small deployments, there may not be a meaningful distinction between the "provider", "authorization server", and "issuer". However, for more complicated setups, there may be a one-to-many (or many-to-many) relationship: a provider may rent out multiple issuer identifiers to separate tenants, then provide multiple authorization servers, possibly with different supported feature sets, to interact with their clients.

PostgreSQL supports bearer tokens, defined in RFC 6750, which are a type of access token used with OAuth 2.0 where the token is an opaque string. The format of the access token is implementation specific and is chosen by each authorization server.

The following configuration options are supported for OAuth:

An HTTPS URL which is either the exact issuer identifier of the authorization server, as defined by its discovery document, or a well-known URI that points directly to that discovery document. This parameter is required.

When an OAuth client connects to the server, a URL for the discovery document will be constructed using the issuer identifier. By default, this URL uses the conventions of OpenID Connect Discovery: the path /.well-known/openid-configuration will be appended to the end of the issuer identifier. Alternatively, if the issuer contains a /.well-known/ path segment, that URL will be provided to the client as-is.

The OAuth client in libpq requires the server's issuer setting to exactly match the issuer identifier which is provided in the discovery document, which must in turn match the client's oauth_issuer setting. No variations in case or formatting are permitted.

A space-separated list of the OAuth scopes needed for the server to both authorize the client and authenticate the user. Appropriate values are determined by the authorization server and the OAuth validation module used (see Chapter 50 for more information on validators). This parameter is required.

The library to use for validating bearer tokens. If given, the name must exactly match one of the libraries listed in oauth_validator_libraries. This parameter is optional unless oauth_validator_libraries contains more than one library, in which case it is required.

Allows for mapping between OAuth identity provider and database user names. See Section 20.2 for details. If a map is not specified, the user name associated with the token (as determined by the OAuth validator) must exactly match the role name being requested. This parameter is optional.

An advanced option which is not intended for common use.

When set to 1, standard user mapping with pg_ident.conf is skipped, and the OAuth validator takes full responsibility for mapping end user identities to database roles. If the validator authorizes the token, the server trusts that the user is allowed to connect under the requested role, and the connection is allowed to proceed regardless of the authentication status of the user.

This parameter is incompatible with map.

delegate_ident_mapping provides additional flexibility in the design of the authentication system, but it also requires careful implementation of the OAuth validator, which must determine whether the provided token carries sufficient end-user privileges in addition to the standard checks required of all validators. Use with caution.

```unknown
/.well-known/openid-configuration

## 20.12. Certificate Authentication #


**URL:** https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/auth-cert.html

**Contents:**
- 20.12. Certificate Authentication #

This authentication method uses SSL client certificates to perform authentication. It is therefore only available for SSL connections; see Section 18.9.2 for SSL configuration instructions. When using this authentication method, the server will require that the client provide a valid, trusted certificate. No password prompt will be sent to the client. The cn (Common Name) attribute of the certificate will be compared to the requested database user name, and if they match the login will be allowed. User name mapping can be used to allow cn to be different from the database user name.

The following configuration options are supported for SSL certificate authentication:

Allows for mapping between system and database user names. See Section 20.2 for details.

It is redundant to use the clientcert option with cert authentication because cert authentication is effectively trust authentication with clientcert=verify-full.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (unknown):
```unknown
clientcert=verify-full
```

## 20.1. The pg_hba.conf File #


**URL:** https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/auth-pg-hba-conf.html

**Contents:**
- 20.1. The pg_hba.conf File #
  - Note

  - Tip

Client authentication is controlled by a configuration file, which traditionally is named pg_hba.conf and is stored in the database cluster's data directory. (HBA stands for host-based authentication.) A default pg_hba.conf file is installed when the data directory is initialized by initdb. It is possible to place the authentication configuration file elsewhere, however; see the hba_file configuration parameter.

The pg_hba.conf file is read on start-up and when the main server process receives a SIGHUP signal. If you edit the file on an active system, you will need to signal the postmaster (using pg_ctl reload, calling the SQL function pg_reload_conf(), or using kill -HUP) to make it re-read the file.

The preceding statement is not true on Microsoft Windows: there, any changes in the pg_hba.conf file are immediately applied by subsequent new connections.

The system view pg_hba_file_rules can be helpful for pre-testing changes to the pg_hba.conf file, or for diagnosing problems if loading of the file did not have the desired effects. Rows in the view with non-null error fields indicate problems in the corresponding lines of the file.

The general format of the pg_hba.conf file is a set of records, one per line. Blank lines are ignored, as is any text after the # comment character. A record can be continued onto the next line by ending the line with a backslash. (Backslashes are not special except at the end of a line.) A record is made up of a number of fields which are separated by spaces and/or tabs. Fields can contain white space if the field value is double-quoted. Quoting one of the keywords in a database, user, or address field (e.g., all or replication) makes the word lose its special meaning, and just match a database, user, or host with that name. Backslash line continuation applies even within quoted text or comments.

Each authentication record specifies a connection type, a client IP address range (if relevant for the connection type), a database name, a user name, and the authentication method to be used for connections matching these parameters. The first record with a matching connection type, client address, requested database, and user name is used to perform authentication. There is no “fall-through” or “backup”: if one record is chosen and the authentication fails, subsequent records are not considered. If no record matches, access is denied.

Each record can be an include directive or an authentication record. Include directives specify files that can be included, that contain additional records. The records will be inserted in place of the include directives. Include directives only contain two fields: include, include_if_exists or include_dir directive and the file or directory to be included. The file or directory can be a relative or absolute path, and can be double-quoted. For the include_dir form, all files not starting with a . and ending with .conf will be included. Multiple files within an include directory are processed in file name order (according to C locale rules, i.e., numbers before letters, and uppercase letters before lowercase ones).

A record can have several formats:

The meaning of the fields is as follows:

This record matches connection attempts using Unix-domain sockets. Without a record of this type, Unix-domain socket connections are disallowed.

This record matches connection attempts made using TCP/IP. host records match SSL or non-SSL connection attempts as well as GSSAPI encrypted or non-GSSAPI encrypted connection attempts.

Remote TCP/IP connections will not be possible unless the server is started with an appropriate value for the listen_addresses configuration parameter, since the default behavior is to listen for TCP/IP connections only on the local loopback address localhost.

This record matches connection attempts made using TCP/IP, but only when the connection is made with SSL encryption.

To make use of this option the server must be built with SSL support. Furthermore, SSL must be enabled by setting the ssl configuration parameter (see Section 18.9 for more information). Otherwise, the hostssl record is ignored except for logging a warning that it cannot match any connections.

This record type has the opposite behavior of hostssl; it only matches connection attempts made over TCP/IP that do not use SSL.

This record matches connection attempts made using TCP/IP, but only when the connection is made with GSSAPI encryption.

To make use of this option the server must be built with GSSAPI support. Otherwise, the hostgssenc record is ignored except for logging a warning that it cannot match any connections.

This record type has the opposite behavior of hostgssenc; it only matches connection attempts made over TCP/IP that do not use GSSAPI encryption.

Specifies which database name(s) this record matches. The value all specifies that it matches all databases. The value sameuser specifies that the record matches if the requested database has the same name as the requested user. The value samerole specifies that the requested user must be a member of the role with the same name as the requested database. (samegroup is an obsolete but still accepted spelling of samerole.) Superusers are not considered to be members of a role for the purposes of samerole unless they are explicitly members of the role, directly or indirectly, and not just by virtue of being a superuser. The value replication specifies that the record matches if a physical replication connection is requested, however, it doesn't match with logical replication connections. Note that physical replication connections do not specify any particular database whereas logical replication connections do specify it. Otherwise, this is the name of a specific PostgreSQL database or a regular expression. Multiple database names and/or regular expressions can be supplied by separating them with commas.

If the database name starts with a slash (/), the remainder of the name is treated as a regular expression. (See Section 9.7.3.1 for details of PostgreSQL's regular expression syntax.)

A separate file containing database names and/or regular expressions can be specified by preceding the file name with @.

Specifies which database user name(s) this record matches. The value all specifies that it matches all users. Otherwise, this is either the name of a specific database user, a regular expression (when starting with a slash (/), or a group name preceded by +. (Recall that there is no real distinction between users and groups in PostgreSQL; a + mark really means “match any of the roles that are directly or indirectly members of this role”, while a name without a + mark matches only that specific role.) For this purpose, a superuser is only considered to be a member of a role if they are explicitly a member of the role, directly or indirectly, and not just by virtue of being a superuser. Multiple user names and/or regular expressions can be supplied by separating them with commas.

If the user name starts with a slash (/), the remainder of the name is treated as a regular expression. (See Section 9.7.3.1 for details of PostgreSQL's regular expression syntax.)

A separate file containing user names and/or regular expressions can be specified by preceding the file name with @.

Specifies the client machine address(es) that this record matches. This field can contain either a host name, an IP address range, or one of the special key words mentioned below.

An IP address range is specified using standard numeric notation for the range's starting address, then a slash (/) and a CIDR mask length. The mask length indicates the number of high-order bits of the client IP address that must match. Bits to the right of this should be zero in the given IP address. There must not be any white space between the IP address, the /, and the CIDR mask length.

Typical examples of an IPv4 address range specified this way are 172.20.143.89/32 for a single host, or 172.20.143.0/24 for a small network, or 10.6.0.0/16 for a larger one. An IPv6 address range might look like ::1/128 for a single host (in this case the IPv6 loopback address) or fe80::7a31:c1ff:0000:0000/96 for a small network. 0.0.0.0/0 represents all IPv4 addresses, and ::0/0 represents all IPv6 addresses. To specify a single host, use a mask length of 32 for IPv4 or 128 for IPv6. In a network address, do not omit trailing zeroes.

An entry given in IPv4 format will match only IPv4 connections, and an entry given in IPv6 format will match only IPv6 connections, even if the represented address is in the IPv4-in-IPv6 range.

You can also write all to match any IP address, samehost to match any of the server's own IP addresses, or samenet to match any address in any subnet that the server is directly connected to.

If a host name is specified (anything that is not an IP address range or a special key word is treated as a host name), that name is compared with the result of a reverse name resolution of the client's IP address (e.g., reverse DNS lookup, if DNS is used). Host name comparisons are case insensitive. If there is a match, then a forward name resolution (e.g., forward DNS lookup) is performed on the host name to check whether any of the addresses it resolves to are equal to the client's IP address. If both directions match, then the entry is considered to match. (The host name that is used in pg_hba.conf should be the one that address-to-name resolution of the client's IP address returns, otherwise the line won't be matched. Some host name databases allow associating an IP address with multiple host names, but the operating system will only return one host name when asked to resolve an IP address.)

A host name specification that starts with a dot (.) matches a suffix of the actual host name. So .example.com would match foo.example.com (but not just example.com).

When host names are specified in pg_hba.conf, you should make sure that name resolution is reasonably fast. It can be of advantage to set up a local name resolution cache such as nscd. Also, you may wish to enable the configuration parameter log_hostname to see the client's host name instead of the IP address in the log.

These fields do not apply to local records.

Users sometimes wonder why host names are handled in this seemingly complicated way, with two name resolutions including a reverse lookup of the client's IP address. This complicates use of the feature in case the client's reverse DNS entry is not set up or yields some undesirable host name. It is done primarily for efficiency: this way, a connection attempt requires at most two resolver lookups, one reverse and one forward. If there is a resolver problem with some address, it becomes only that client's problem. A hypothetical alternative implementation that only did forward lookups would have to resolve every host name mentioned in pg_hba.conf during every connection attempt. That could be quite slow if many names are listed. And if there is a resolver problem with one of the host names, it becomes everyone's problem.

Also, a reverse lookup is necessary to implement the suffix matching feature, because the actual client host name needs to be known in order to match it against the pattern.

Note that this behavior is consistent with other popular implementations of host name-based access control, such as the Apache HTTP Server and TCP Wrappers.

These two fields can be used as an alternative to the IP-address/mask-length notation. Instead of specifying the mask length, the actual mask is specified in a separate column. For example, 255.0.0.0 represents an IPv4 CIDR mask length of 8, and 255.255.255.255 represents a CIDR mask length of 32.

These fields do not apply to local records.

Specifies the authentication method to use when a connection matches this record. The possible choices are summarized here; details are in Section 20.3. All the options are lower case and treated case sensitively, so even acronyms like ldap must be specified as lower case.

Allow the connection unconditionally. This method allows anyone that can connect to the PostgreSQL database server to login as any PostgreSQL user they wish, without the need for a password or any other authentication. See Section 20.4 for details.

Reject the connection unconditionally. This is useful for “filtering out” certain hosts from a group, for example a reject line could block a specific host from connecting, while a later line allows the remaining hosts in a specific network to connect.

Perform SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication to verify the user's password. See Section 20.5 for details.

Perform SCRAM-SHA-256 or MD5 authentication to verify the user's password. See Section 20.5 for details.

Support for MD5-encrypted passwords is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of PostgreSQL. Refer to Section 20.5 for details about migrating to another password type.

Require the client to supply an unencrypted password for authentication. Since the password is sent in clear text over the network, this should not be used on untrusted networks. See Section 20.5 for details.

Use GSSAPI to authenticate the user. This is only available for TCP/IP connections. See Section 20.6 for details. It can be used in conjunction with GSSAPI encryption.

Use SSPI to authenticate the user. This is only available on Windows. See Section 20.7 for details.

Obtain the operating system user name of the client by contacting the ident server on the client and check if it matches the requested database user name. Ident authentication can only be used on TCP/IP connections. When specified for local connections, peer authentication will be used instead. See Section 20.8 for details.

Obtain the client's operating system user name from the operating system and check if it matches the requested database user name. This is only available for local connections. See Section 20.9 for details.

Authenticate using an LDAP server. See Section 20.10 for details.

Authenticate using a RADIUS server. See Section 20.11 for details.

Authenticate using SSL client certificates. See Section 20.12 for details.

Authenticate using the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) service provided by the operating system. See Section 20.13 for details.

Authenticate using the BSD Authentication service provided by the operating system. See Section 20.14 for details.

Authorize and optionally authenticate using a third-party OAuth 2.0 identity provider. See Section 20.15 for details.

After the auth-method field, there can be field(s) of the form name=value that specify options for the authentication method. Details about which options are available for which authentication methods appear below.

In addition to the method-specific options listed below, there is a method-independent authentication option clientcert, which can be specified in any hostssl record. This option can be set to verify-ca or verify-full. Both options require the client to present a valid (trusted) SSL certificate, while verify-full additionally enforces that the cn (Common Name) in the certificate matches the username or an applicable mapping. This behavior is similar to the cert authentication method (see Section 20.12) but enables pairing the verification of client certificates with any authentication method that supports hostssl entries.

On any record using client certificate authentication (i.e. one using the cert authentication method or one using the clientcert option), you can specify which part of the client certificate credentials to match using the clientname option. This option can have one of two values. If you specify clientname=CN, which is the default, the username is matched against the certificate's Common Name (CN). If instead you specify clientname=DN the username is matched against the entire Distinguished Name (DN) of the certificate. This option is probably best used in conjunction with a username map. The comparison is done with the DN in RFC 2253 format. To see the DN of a client certificate in this format, do

Care needs to be taken when using this option, especially when using regular expression matching against the DN.

This line will be replaced by the contents of the given file.

This line will be replaced by the content of the given file if the file exists. Otherwise, a message is logged to indicate that the file has been skipped.

This line will be replaced by the contents of all the files found in the directory, if they don't start with a . and end with .conf, processed in file name order (according to C locale rules, i.e., numbers before letters, and uppercase letters before lowercase ones).

Files included by @ constructs are read as lists of names, which can be separated by either whitespace or commas. Comments are introduced by #, just as in pg_hba.conf, and nested @ constructs are allowed. Unless the file name following @ is an absolute path, it is taken to be relative to the directory containing the referencing file.

Since the pg_hba.conf records are examined sequentially for each connection attempt, the order of the records is significant. Typically, earlier records will have tight connection match parameters and weaker authentication methods, while later records will have looser match parameters and stronger authentication methods. For example, one might wish to use trust authentication for local TCP/IP connections but require a password for remote TCP/IP connections. In this case a record specifying trust authentication for connections from 127.0.0.1 would appear before a record specifying password authentication for a wider range of allowed client IP addresses.

To connect to a particular database, a user must not only pass the pg_hba.conf checks, but must have the CONNECT privilege for the database. If you wish to restrict which users can connect to which databases, it's usually easier to control this by granting/revoking CONNECT privilege than to put the rules in pg_hba.conf entries.

Some examples of pg_hba.conf entries are shown in Example 20.1. See the next section for details on the different authentication methods.
